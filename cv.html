JACQUELINE W. NUZZO<br>
(b. 1995)<br>
jwnuzzo@gmail.com<br><br>
 
Jacqueline W. Nuzzo (b. 1995) works primarily in printmaking, drawing, and collage. Her practice experiments with ambiguity, repetition, and the body as a vehicle for expression. Biomorphic, abstracted, figurative forms are the subject of her works, and she often incorporates repeating patterns as a way to anchor these figures in an abstracted space. <br><br>

Her work explores the idea of identity in a society where conformity is increasingly valued over individuality. She is interested in the ways in which social pressures can strip away our unique identities, leaving us to blend in with the masses. Nuzzo uses biomorphic forms and pattern as a way to depict the gradual dissolution of individual identity within a larger collective. Through the repetition and abstraction of these forms, she creates a sense of ambiguity that reflects the loss of individuality that can occur when we conform to societal norms. By exploring these themes in her work, Nuzzo hopes to provoke questions about the nature of identity in a world that often values conformity over self-expression.<br><br>

Nuzzo graduated from St. Olaf College in 2017 with a BA in Studio Art and Biology. She is currently an MFA candidate in Printmedia at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. <br><br>
