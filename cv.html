<p>

Jacqueline W. Nuzzo is a designer and fine artist working in printmaking, drawing, and textiles. <br><br>

With six years of experience under her belt, Jacqueline has worked with hospitality, residential and interior design clients within the art consulting industry. She has proven experience leading a creative team and thrives in creative direction, team building and management. 

<br><br>

As an artist, Jacqueline's research is based in the fields of perception and pattern. As part of her MFA degree, she published her written thesis "Patterns of Disruption: Repetitiona and Originality" through The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. This research is connected to her own artistic practice that uses the grid as a visual motif and a system of organization, investigating repetition via the grid from art historical, philosophical, and psychological frameworks. <br><br>

Jacqueline W. Nuzzo graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2024 with an MFA in Printmedia, and St. Olaf College in 2017 with a BA in Studio Art and Biology.  <br><br><br>
