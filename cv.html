<p>

Jacqueline W. Nuzzo (b. 1995) is an artist working in printmaking, drawing, and textiles. Her practice disrupts patterns and questions how repetition informs the aesethetic experience. 

<br><br>

Most of her work uses the concept of the repeat tile, a square that creates a seamless design once placed alongside itself. Using the grid as a foundation for organization, Nuzzo disrupts that foundation by making the perfect, imperfect. Subtle variations in the repeat tile create discontinuity annd challenge the legibility within the the visual information. <br><br>

For Nuzzo, fabric is an alternate substrate to paper. Stitching fabric tiles creates a feeling of tension that does not come with paper. The color of the fabric can be made through hand-dyeing techniques that are a mix of intentional and intuitive, and Nuzzo's gravitation towards subtle tonal variations of the primary color palette can be seen throughout her works. <br><br>

Jacqueline W. Nuzzo graduated from St. Olaf College in 2017 with a BA in Studio Art and Biology. She is currently an MFA candidate in Printmedia at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. <br><br><br>
