JACQUELINE W. NUZZO<br>
(b. 1995)<br>
jwnuzzo@gmail.com<br><br>
 
Jacqueline W. Nuzzo (b. 1995) works primarily in printmaking, drawing, and collage. Her practice experiments with ambiguity, repetition, and the body as a vehicle for expression. Biomorphic, abstracted, figurative forms are the subject of her works, and she often incorporates repeating patterns as a way to anchor these figures in an abstracted space. Nuzzo typically starts with drawing these biomorphic shapes on paper, then digitally capturing them and producing screenprints and heat-press paper, and then collaging those materials into new pieces. She draws figures, reuses them, and then draws new ones. By relying on a constantly evolving library of biomorphic, abstracted depictions of the body, she can spontaneously deconstruct and reassemble these matrices to build new compositions. This creates a space to work from instinct, impulse, and freedom.<br><br>

Recently, Nuzzo has begun drawing and printing on large art paper rolls without the intention of ever cutting it down. These drawings are installed on the wall, close to the ceiling, and then partially rolled out onto the floor, implying that the drawing may never be finished and that all works are forever a work in progress. <br><br>

A theme within her work is the intersection between repetition and individuality, and conformity and belonging. How do we navigate our own individuality when we are confirming to being cloaked in the same repeating patterns? Along with pattern, the forms have a level of ambiguity that some would consider to be stripping it of any distinguishing and identifying details. <br><br>

Nuzzo graduated from St. Olaf College in 2017 with a BA in Studio Art and Biology. She is currently an MFA candidate in Printmedia at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. <br><br><br>
