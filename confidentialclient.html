<h2>
	CONFIDENTIAL CLIENT
</h2>


<p>
	This project was made for a confidential client based in Sunnyvale, CA.  The theme was "celebrating people" with the scope including 8 levels of artwork. <br><br>As Grand Image's Lead Digital Artist and Content Manager, I was responsible for overseeing all of the digital artworks made by my team of four, in addition to creating many myself. Each floor contained artwork made by Grand Image's Painting and Sculpture studios, and we often collaborated with each studio to create installations. Prior to production, I quoted all commission projects by estimating project hours, address any technical issues, determine budgetary constraints and project scope. <br><br>These were made while I was the Lead Digital Artist and Content Manager at Grand Image from 2020-2022 under the art direction of Kate Maass, Art Director at Grand Image. All works were created by me unless otherwise stated.

<div class="description">I oversaw the production of this wallcovering.  This full wall installation includes a custom wallcovering designed by the Digital Studio with actual books on top. The wallcovering is made from scans of hundreds of individual pages collaged into a seamless pattern. The Painting Studio installed many books over the wallcovering and sculpted them to remain open. Painted in were geometric designs, illustrations from literary figures and novels, and easter eggs paying homage to the client on top.<br><br>Creative and Production: Jacqueline Nuzzo and Grand Image, Ltd.</div>
